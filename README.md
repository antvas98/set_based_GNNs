# set_based_GNNs

This repository contains a collection of scripts for transforming datasets and performing graph classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The scripts are designed to work with datasets from [TUDataset]([url](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/)) and implement various steps of the pipeline, including dataset transformation, GNN architecture implementation, hyperparameter selection, and cross-validation.
